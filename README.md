# 🌦️ Weather Widget

A simple **React + Vite** weather app that fetches real-time weather data using the **OpenWeather API** and displays it in a clean Material UI card interface.  
The app dynamically shows **weather images** (Sunny, Rainy, Snowy, Foggy, Cloudy, Thunderstorm, Hot) based on temperature & humidity conditions.
